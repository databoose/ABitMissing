# ABitMissing
A simple python script to check the integrity of the data on your storage device via hashing in sha-256, it is highly advised only to add files into the list that you know will not be changed by either you or automatically by another program.

Note: Two files will be created in whatever directory the python file is ran in to log both the directory names and hashes, it is recommended to run in its own specific folder for organization.

Replace "YOUR-FILE-PATH-HERE" in the script with the desired file path of the file you want to add to the hashing list.
