# ABitMissing
A simple python3 script to check the integrity of the data on your storage device via hashing in sha-256
Notes: 

>Two files will be created in whatever directory the python file is ran in to log both the directory names and hashes, it is recommended to run in its own specific folder for organization.
>
>File paths and or names will need to be changed accordingly if the user wants to hash a specific file, by default the script only hashes the randomly generated files.
>
>Run "python3 ABitMissing.py --wipe-data" if you want to wipe all randomly generated files, the hash file and timestamp file, all files will need to be within the same folder for this to work.
